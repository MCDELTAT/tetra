Tetranucleotide Frequency Viewer
Continued from CSE455 at CSUSB, Spring 2016

Uses three.js as the main WebGL implementation library

To run the app, you can simply open the index.html in Firefox (allows CORS by default)
Otherwise you will have to run a development server. If you have python, simply run:
'python3 -m http.server'
in the same directory as the index.html file. 

As soon as a stable experimental build is reached, the files will be hosted online and the above steps can be skipped.

To-Do:
1) General Cleanup. ES6 Best practices of moving global declaration to init() function. (Deadline-Oct. 19)
2) Reconfigure hiding layers (v81 uses new id system) --> Abstract. (Deadline-Oct. 20)
3) Figure out the three.js grid system, things aren't quite to scale. (Dealine-Oct. 20)
4) Axis labels (Deadline-Oct.24)
5) Get the visibility buttons to generate on their own. --> Abstract. (Deadline-Oct. 27)
6) CSS Stuff. Bar across top with 3 buttons: open file, layer select panel, camera reset. (almost done)
7) Pregenerate 20 colors for use on species. (Deadline-Oct 31)
8) Hide graph walls when camera is obstructed (water demo).

Done: 
1) Basic Graph Set-Up
3) Get input from the CSV file
4) Rebuild web-view to use onShowFileChooser to select files.
