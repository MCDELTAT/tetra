Prototype 2 of the Tetranucleotide Frequency Viewer
CSUSB, Spring 2016

Uses three.js as the main WebGL implementation library

To run the app, simply open index.html, or build the app which redirects to the hosted version of the files.

To-Do:
1) Figure out the three.js grid system, things aren't quite to scale.
2) Axis labels
3) Get the buttons to generate on their own. --> Abstract.
4) CSS Stuff. Bar across top with 3 buttons: open file, layer select panel, camera reset.
4) Hide graph walls when camera is obstructed (water demo).

Done: 
1) Basic Graph Set-Up
2) Toggle Layers On and Off
3) Get input from the CSV file
4) Rebuild web-view to use onShowFileChooser to select files.
